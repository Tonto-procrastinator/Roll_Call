# Hello World!
Welcome to my little project.

## Oy?
It's a game. Remeber those little wooden toy maze brain teaser with a little ball inside? That. That's the game. That's it. Really.

## Huh?
I had this idea while learning Godot's 3D physics: a small, simple, infinte Steam game.

## üòµ‚Äçüí´
For now:
1. download Godot 4 or higher,
2. download the repo,
3. open roll_call.godot in Godot (use **Edit** at first, you'll be able to use **Run** the next time),
4. Go into the Library tab,
5. Install Gramps' Steam addon in the /addons directory,
6. Click on the clapper board üé¨ on the top right corner of the Godot window,
7. Have fun (requirement).

## Wah?
Sure, you can help me with this project. From constructive comments, to GD Script guru mentorship. Just join the discussion.

## Hmm.
I don't care. You can do whatever you want with the codes. The only thing I don't want is to take this game, as is, and start selling it. I mean, if you do, good luck, because I already give it away. Else, you can use snippets, parts, even the whole thing and paste into your bigger game as a minigame. If you do use any of the code here, please say so, I might claim some bragging rights if you game does well.

## 'nuf.
Indeed. Have fun.
